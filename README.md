# HotS-Drafting-Minigame
Drafting minigame for Heroes of the Storm

My goal in making this game is to provide a platform for players to learn how to draft effectively and to better understand map strategy.  This is to be done via providing well-reasoned feedback to mock-drafts against professional HotS eSports compositions and providing basic map strategy information.

Things that you can do as yet:
1)  select a map to see its minimap.
2)  Click on that minimap in order to see a zoomed in map with strategy advice.
3)  Complete a mock draft.

While drafting the program will:
1)  select an enemy composition that is used in professional HotS eSports.
2)  if you ban or select a hero used on that team, it will select a new one that still uses heroes it has already chosen.
3)  If it runs out of options due to exceptional drafting on your part, it checks against generic comps that aren't necessarily for that map.
4)  If the generic comps run out, it randomly selects heroes to fill in the gaps, while still using what it has already chosen, and not conflicting with anyone's bans or with the player team.

What isn't in the game yet:
1)  basic hero information
2)  draft feedback
